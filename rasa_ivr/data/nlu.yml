    - for the sink whenever i turn on the hot water theres like a little bit of hot water and then it just turns cold and also theres very low water pressure from it so im not sure if its the age of the water heater or what the issue is?
    - i had a issue with my shower drain it seems to be clogged i tried different chemicals i left it overnight there was some hair i took it out but even now there is like water still in the tub like just standing
    - my shower drain is clogged i tried different types of chemicals just to get out the there was some hair left i took it out but still whenever i run the water it just doesn't go through like a little bit goes through and then there is still water just staying back on the tub
    - so i have a issue with my toilet whenever i flush it the water just keeps running so im just thinking its gonna be wasting a lot of water uhim not sure if its the issue with the flapper or what it is
    - theres little bit of hot water and it runs for like five seconds and then after that it becomes cold and also there is no hot water coming out of my kitchen sink but not my bathroom sink
    - yea so for my bathroom sink the faucet theres like water dripping out of it and it's leading to a lot of water waste so I'm not sure what the issue is are you able to fix that for me
    - so the toilet is not flushing and theres like little water in the tank there is also this bad smell thats coming from it
    - the water is not going through the sink and im not sure what the issue is it has been like this for the past couple days now
    - so the toilet is clogged and the whenever i try to like flush it it wont flush i tried to use a plunger to get it uncloged that also didnt work
    - so my water heater hasnt been working i cant seem to get hot water in my sinks and its really slow when the water comes out
    - so my bathroom sink theres water dripping out of it off the faucet its like the water wont stop coming out
    - the faucet doesn't close and water still runs from it when i try to close it
    - so since yesterday the faucet in my sink is not working like the water thats coming from it is very slow and its making me very frustrated
    - so i have water heating issue like my water only comes out as cold and not hot
    - i have a leaky pipe and one of my pipes is broken so can you guys help me with my broken pipe
    - so ive had a shower that has not been working its been like one or two hours and i need help
    - the kitchen sink is broken the water is not going through it it only goes through when i turn the kitchen garbage disposal on
    - This issue has been causing us problems for years and I want to see if there is a fix for it our utility Sink has to be snaked every 3 to 4 months because the water drains so slowly the sink fills up every time the washer drains and takes minutes to clear when it does drain I do hear gurgling noises this is the only drain in the entire house that has an issue
    - i only have the cold water washing machine tap hooked up and i turned off it doesnt leak when its on it leaks through the handle
    - i have a water heater in my basement and i notice that the top of the water heater is very hot from where its venting out and like the plastic rubber plugs that are around the hot and cold connections are melting also today i noticed that there is a little bit of water around the cold water plug too
    - Good morning I need to schedule a plumbing appointment for next week I have a leaky pipe in my bathroom that needs fixing
    - i got a issue man the shower drain is clogged i think and the water is not going through it it stands there for a couple minutes  
    - so the i got a couple issues in my bathroom the water pressure in the sink and also in the shower drain are very slow and whenever i try to turn on the shower from the shower head like when i twist the handle it makes a squeaky sound 
    - Well, the kitchen sink started leaking around the edges last week. I tried tightening the pipes underneath, but it didn't help. The leak seems to get worse when the dishwasher is running
    - The bathroom toilet keeps running, and it's been like this for a few days. I looked inside the tank and tried adjusting the chain, but nothing changed. It's also making a hissing sound
    - We noticed a wet patch on the dining room ceiling directly below the upstairs bathroom. Haven't done anything yet because I'm not sure where it's coming from. It appeared after we used the bathtub
    - Our water heater isn't providing hot water since yesterday morning. I checked the pilot light, and it's on, but the water's still cold. This happened suddenly; it was fine the day before
    - There's a slow drain in the shower that's been getting worse over the past month. I've used a commercial drain cleaner twice, but it only helped temporarily. Now, water pools really quickly
    - The cold water tap in the master bedroom sink has very low pressure. It's been like this since last week. I removed the aerator to see if it was clogged, but that didn't make any difference
    - I've been hearing a knocking noise in the walls when I turn on the water or flush the toilet. It started about two weeks ago. I haven't tried anything yet; I'm worried it might be the pipes
    - Our garbage disposal is making a loud grinding noise but isn't working properly. I tried pressing the reset button and even checked for obvious blockages, but I can't find the problem
    - There's a foul smell coming from the bathroom sink. I cleaned the P-trap under the sink last weekend, thinking that was the issue, but the smell is still there, especially after running water.
    - I found water pooling around the base of the water heater. I've not attempted to fix it because I'm not sure if it's a leak or something else. It started just yesterday
    - The basement sump pump seems to be running non-stop, even when it's not raining. I checked for any visible blockages around the intake but didn't find any. It's been like this for a couple of days now
    - I attempted to fix a leaky shower head by replacing the washer inside, but it's still dripping, and now there's also a squealing noise when the water is running
    - We have a new dishwasher, and it's not draining properly. I checked the hose for kinks and cleaned the filter, but it didn't solve the issue. This started happening right after we installed it
    - There's a gurgling sound coming from the kitchen sink drain whenever we use the washing machine. I haven't tried anything yet because I'm not sure if they're even related
    - The outdoor faucet is leaking, and I tried replacing the rubber washer inside, but when I turned the water back on, it started leaking even more. It's been like this for over a week
    - I did not take any steps and there are there were no changes that I've noticed
